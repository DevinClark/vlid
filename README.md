# vlid.js

Lightweight validation library with NO dependencies targeting web browsers and Node.js. A nice Joi alternative
with a similar API.

A full featured validation library at just **8kb** minified (before gzipping).

NOTE: `vlid.js` targets language features supported in 90%+ browsers. This means that it does use some more
widely-supported ES6 features, and thus requires a modern-ish browser and/or Node 8+. Most notably, IE11 is
not supported. All versions of Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Edge released within the past several years are
fully supported.

## Installation

Install from NPM:

`npm install vlid --save`

Use in your JavaScript:

`const v = require('vlid');`

Or with `import`:

`import v from 'vlid';`

## Usage

Full API docs coming soon. Still working on what the full public API will be.
